## Overview

API keys authenticate your SDK and Proxy integrations with the Avaliar backend. Each key is scoped to your organization and can be configured with specific permissions, environments, and IP restrictions.

Manage API keys at [app.avaliar.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.avaliar.ai/settings/api-keys).

## Key Scopes

Every API key has one or more scopes that determine how it can be used.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **sdk** | Send traces from the [Python SDK](/sdk/installation). Required for `@traceable` and detection calls. |
| **proxy** | Route LLM traffic through the [Avaliar Proxy](/proxy/overview) gateway. Requires an active **Pro plan**. |

A key can have both scopes if you use a single key for both SDK and Proxy integrations.

## Creating a Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to [app.avaliar.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.avaliar.ai/settings/api-keys) and click **Create Key**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Key">
    Provide the following details:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Name** | A descriptive name (e.g., `production-sdk`, `staging-proxy`) |
    | **Scopes** | Select `sdk`, `proxy`, or both |
    | **Environment** | Choose `development`, `staging`, or `production` |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    After creation, the full API key is displayed once. Copy it and store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. The full key is only displayed once at creation time. If you lose it, you will need to rotate or create a new key.
</Warning>

## Key Format

API keys use the following format:

```
avl_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Keys start with the `avl_` prefix
- Only the first 8 characters of the key are stored for identification purposes
- The full key is shown only once at creation time

## Rotating Keys

Rotating a key generates a new key value while keeping the same name, scopes, environment, and configuration. This is useful for scheduled key rotation or when a key may have been compromised.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Key">
    Locate the key you want to rotate in the API Keys list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rotate">
    Click **Rotate** and confirm. A new key value is generated immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Your Integration">
    Replace the old key with the new one in your application configuration. The old key is invalidated immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Rotation invalidates the previous key value instantly. Make sure you update your application before discarding the new key.
</Info>

## Revoking Keys

Revoking a key permanently deactivates it. Revoked keys cannot be reactivated or rotated. Any requests using a revoked key will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

To revoke a key, click **Revoke** next to the key in the API Keys list and confirm.

## Usage Tracking

The API Keys page shows usage information for each key:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Usage count** | Total number of API calls made with this key |
| **Last used** | Timestamp of the most recent API call |

Use this information to identify unused keys and clean up stale credentials.

## IP Allowlist

For additional security, you can restrict an API key to specific IP addresses. When an IP allowlist is configured, requests from any IP not on the list are rejected.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single IP">
    ```
    203.0.113.42
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple IPs">
    ```
    203.0.113.42
    203.0.113.43
    198.51.100.0
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Use IP allowlists in production to prevent unauthorized use of your API keys, even if the key value is accidentally exposed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Separate Keys per Environment" icon="layer-group">
    Create distinct keys for development, staging, and production. This keeps your environments isolated and makes it easy to revoke access to a single environment without affecting others.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Establish a key rotation schedule (e.g., every 90 days) to limit the window of exposure if a key is compromised.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use IP Allowlists in Production" icon="shield">
    Restrict production keys to known IP addresses. This adds a second layer of protection beyond the key itself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-simple">
    Review key usage counts and last-used timestamps regularly. Revoke keys that are no longer in use.
